# What is .NET MAUI?
- **M**ulti plataform **a**pp **U**I
- Framework to build cross-plataform desktop for Mac, Windows, iOS and Android apps from a single codebase
- Uses MVVM
- Can access native APIs completely in C#
- Can build native cross-plataform UIs with XAML (XML based markup) or completely in C#
## How does the cross plataform works
- MAUI will get the XAML elements and genarate/render the native controls for the target plataform
  - IOs -> UIKit
  - Android -> AndroidWidgets
  - MacOS -> Catalyst
  - Windows -> AppSDK and WinUI 3
- Abstracts native APIs into a common surface
