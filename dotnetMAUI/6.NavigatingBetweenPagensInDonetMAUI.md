# Navigation
- In MAUI is possible to navigate between pages in many diferent forms and, also, pass data from one page to another
## URI Shell-based Navigation
- Instead of navigating between actual pages, a shell is created to containing pages and on the act of navigation the content of the shell is refreshed in order to display a new page. (Exactly like single-page apps in webdev)
## Singleton vs Transient
- Singleton:
  - Services registered as Singletons will be created one time and then persist the state throughout the aplication, that means that if a page is a Singleton this page will be created only one time and then be updated as needed
- Transient
  - Services registered as Transient will be created every time they'r needed and then disposed when not needed, that means the if a page is Transient this page will be created and destroyed "on demand"

- Insight: Use singletons for controll pages and Transient for pages that depend on singletons.
  - Ex: One page contains all the products this is a Singleton since is not changed very often and don't depend of any other Model. When a product is clicked a new page is rendered, showing details about the clicked product. The details page should be Transient, since we only need that page when a specific product is clicked, so the whole page will be created with the right data and then destroyed after no loger needed. See the [DetatailsPage](../HelloWorld/MainPage.xaml.cs) in the [HelloWorld](../HelloWord) project for a quick example

## Adding a new Page
Create a new MAUI ContentPage and his respectives controll files and bind then together
- `ViewModels/AnotherViewModel.cs`

```cs
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;

namespace SomeApp.ViewModels
{
    public partial class AnotherViewModel : ObservableObject
    {
    }
}
```

- `AnotherPage.xaml`

```xaml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             x:Class="SomeApp.AnotherPage"
             Title="SomePage">
    <VerticalStackLayout>
        <Label 
            Text="Welcome to .NET MAUI!"
            VerticalOptions="Center" 
            HorizontalOptions="Center" />
    </VerticalStackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

- `AnotherPage.xaml.cs`

```cs
using SomeApp.ViewModels;

namespace SomeApp;

public partial class AnotherPage : ContentPage
{
    public DetailsPage(DetailViewModel vm)
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        BindingContext = vm;
    }
}
```

Now register the new page as a Service (can be a Singleton or Transient)
- MauiProgram.cs

```cs
builder.Services.AddTransient<AnotherPage>();
builder.Services.AddTransient<AnotherViewModel>();
```

As studied before, since this View/ViewModel are transient thoes services will be created and disposed on demand. See [MauiProgram.cs](../HelloWorld/MauiProgram.cs) of the HelloWorld project

### Register de new page with the routing system of MAUI
- In order to habilitate actual navigation the pages need to be routed. Observe the boilerplate code for the HelloWorld project
- [AppShell.xaml](../HelloWorld/AppShell.xaml)
```xaml
<Shell
    x:Class="HelloWorld.AppShell"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
    xmlns:local="clr-namespace:HelloWorld"
    Shell.FlyoutBehavior="Disabled"
    Title="HelloWorld">

    <ShellContent
        Title="Home"
        ContentTemplate="{DataTemplate local:MainPage}"
        Route="MainPage" />

</Shell>
```
Notice that the `ShellContent` component has a property named `Route` pointing to the `MainPage` class, indicating that the first page to be loaded when the app start is the `MainPage` view

Since the new page is not part of the shell it self, one must register the new page on the code bihind of the `AppShell` view as a route
- `AppShell.xaml.cs`
```cs
namespace SomeApp
{
    public partial class AppShell : Shell
    {
        public AppShell()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            Routing.RegisterRoute(nameof(SomePage), typeof(SomePage));
        }
    }
}
```
- Look at [MainPage.xaml](../HelloWorld/MainPage.xaml) for a example on how to implement the navigation it self
  - Look at the `<Label>` component inside the `<Frame>` component chield of `ColletionView`
  - Look at the `async Task Tap(string s)` method at the code-behind file [MainViewMdel.cs](../HelloWorld/ViewModels/DetailViewModel.cs)
## Passing Data from one page to another
1) As a URL (string interpolation)
  ```cs
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;

namespace SomeApp.ViewModels
{
    public partial class SomeViewModel : ObservableObject
    {
        async Task ChangePage(string s)
        {
            await Shell.Current.GotToAsync($"{namof(AnotherPage)}?Text={s}");
        }
    }
}
  ```
2) As a paramater of type `Dictionary<string,object>`

  ```cs
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;

namespace SomeApp.ViewModels
{
    public partial class SomeViewModel : ObservableObject
    {
        async Task ChangePage(string s)
        {
            await Shell.Current.GotToAsync(namof(AnotherPage), new Dictionary<string, object>
                {
                    {"SomeKey", new someObject()}
                }   
            );
        }
    }
}
  ```

For an example of type 1 look at `async Task Tap(string s)` method at the code-behind file [MainViewMdel.cs](../HelloWorld/ViewModels/DetailViewModel.cs)

## Reciving Data into a ViewModel class
- To properly reciev some that as paramater in a ViewModel, one can decorate the ViewModel class it self with the `[QueryProperty(string name, string queryId]`

```cs
using CommunityToolkit.Mvvm.ComponentModel;
namespace SomeApp.ViewModels
{

    [QueryProperty("SomeProperty", "Data")]

    public partial class AnotherViewModel : ObservableObject
    {
        [ObservableProperty]
        string SomeProperty;

    }
}
```

### Some anathomy
Notice that in the snipet 1 above we did something like this:
```
 await Shell.Current.GotToAsync($"{namof(AnotherPage)}?Data={s}");
                                                       ^^^^^^^^
```
the `QueryProperty` decorator takes 2 parameters:
  1) `name`: represents the name of the ViewModel class property that will reciev the data passed
  2) `queryId`: represents what to look for in the URL-like string that one passed to the `GoToAsync` method

### Navigating back
To navigate back to a page is possible to use a FS-like sintax
```cs
async Task GoBack() => await Shell.Curent.GoToAsync("../SomePage");
```
